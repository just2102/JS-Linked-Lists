# JS-Linked-Lists
## This project was completed as part of The Odin Project curriculum. Here I worked with a data structure known as a linked list. I learned to create a linked list and manipulate its elements.
### For example, you can add or remove elements by index, add a new head element or remove the head element.
### Compared to arrays, it's easier to access and work with head elements of linked lists. However, it is difficult to access middle elements of a linked list because it requires computing every element before the one we need.
#### Thus, there certainly is a use for linked lists in certain situations.
